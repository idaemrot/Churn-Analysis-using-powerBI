## 📁 Report Structure

The Power BI report is divided into **four key sections**, each focused on a specific aspect of churn analysis:

### 1. 🔍 Churned Customer Analysis  
Analyzes only the customers who have **already churned**, helping identify patterns and key factors behind customer loss. Results are presented through clear, actionable visualizations.

### 2. 📈 Overall Customer Analysis  
Provides a **comprehensive overview** of the entire customer base, including service usage, demographics, and customer behavior.

### 3. ⚠️ Risk Analysis of Non-Churned Customers  
Uses a **machine learning model** to predict which currently active (non-churned) customers are at **high risk of churning** in the future. These predictions are visualized to support strategic decision-making.

### 4. ❓ Q&A Section  
Includes an **interactive Q&A page** that allows users to ask natural language questions and explore insights dynamically using Power BI's Q&A feature.
